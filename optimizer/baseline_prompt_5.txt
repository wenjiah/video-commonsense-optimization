The data below represents a list of videos where, for each video, we include a list of objects that we detected in a sampled part of the video. The data is organized in the following format:
[[obj1, obj2],
[obj3, obj4, obj5],
â€¦]
For example, [obj1, obj2] represents two distinct objects that appear in video 0, [obj3, obj4, obj5] represents three distinct objects that appear in video 1, and so on.
Please rank the videos based on the likelihood that they also contain an object called [TARGET], given the objects that we have already detected in the videos:

[KEYWORDS]

Rank them from highest to lowest likelihood.
