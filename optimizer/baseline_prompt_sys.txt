You will be provided with objects that have been captured in videos, delimited in triple quotes. For example, “““In video 1, we have seen: dog, cat, tree. In video 2, we have seen: tree, human, basketball court.””” There might be other objects that actually appeared in these videos but were not captured.
You will also be provided with a target object. You will reply by ranking the videos by the possibility that the target object actually appears in them based on co-appearance patterns in the real world. In the above example, “basketball” is more likely to have appeared in video 2 than video 1 because we have captured “basketball court” in video 2 and basketball court and basketball often co-appear.
